### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Majid â€“ DevOps Engineer from Iran

I'm passionate about **automation**, **CI/CD**, and building **reliable delivery pipelines** for software projects. Over the past years, I've been growing my skills around tools like **GitLab CI**, **Ansible**, **Docker**, and **Nexus Repository**, and Iâ€™m now focusing on making production-ready workflows and infrastructures.

ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m working on:
- CI/CD pipelines for frontend applications using GitLab CI
- Automating server setups with Ansible (e.g., Guacamole, ELK Stack)
- Containerizing and deploying projects with Docker
- Managing project dependencies and artifacts using Nexus Repository (apt, Maven, Go, etc.)
- Implementing semantic versioning, tagging, and release automation in GitLab
- Integrating GitLab with Jira to track issues linked to releases via commit messages and merge requests

ðŸš€ My goal is to help teams deliver faster and safer through automation and DevOps practices.
