### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Majid â€“ DevOps Engineer from Iran

I'm passionate about **automation**, **CI/CD**, and building **reliable delivery pipelines** for software projects. Over the past years, I've been growing my skills around tools like **GitLab CI**, **Ansible**, and **Docker**, and Iâ€™m now focusing on making production-ready workflows and infrastructures.

ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m working on:
- CI/CD pipelines for frontend applications using GitLab CI and Jenkins.
- Automating server setups with Ansible (e.g., Guacamole, ELK Stack).
- Containerizing and deploying projects with Docker

ðŸš€ My goal is to help teams deliver faster and safer through automation and DevOps practices. Many of my projects are not OpenSource, So I allowed just to share my CI/CD or Playbooks without their source codes.
